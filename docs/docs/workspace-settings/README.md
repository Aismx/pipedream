# Workspace Settings

When you sign up for a Pipedream account, you'll be guided to create a workspace. After you create your workspace, your workflows and projects will be assigned to your private workspace.

A workspace is a collection of **projects**, **folders** and **workflows**. You can develop workflows within a private workspace, or you can invite others to join your workspace.

You can be a member of one or more workspaces.

## Creating a new workspace

To create another workspace, open the dropdown menu in the top left of the Pipedream dashboard.

Then select **Create new workspace**.

You'll be prompted to name the workspace, but don't worry you can [change the name later](/workspaces/#renaming-a-workspace).

::: tip

**Free** and **Professional** tier accounts are limited to owning one workspace. [Browse plans](/pricing/) that include higher workspace usage.

## Switching between workspaces

To switch between workspaces, open the dropdown menu in the top left of the Pipedream dashboard.

Select which workspace you'd like to start working within, and your Pipedream dashboard context will change to that workspace.

## Workspace settings

Find your current workspace settings like current members, under the **Settings** navigation menu item on the left hand side. Here is where you can manage your workspace settings, including the workspace name, members and member permissions.

### Inviting others to a join a workspace

After opening your workspace settings, open the **Membership** tab.

Invite members to your workspace by entering in their Pipedream username or email address and then clicking **Send**.

::: tip

Pipedream username names are formatted like `@pierce`. They can be found in the bottom left hand corner of the Pipedream dashboard.

If the member does not yet have a Pipedream account, an email will be sent to their inbox containing an invitation link to create an account and join your workspace.

### Managing member permissions

By default, new workspace members are assigned the **Member** level permission.

**Members** will be able to perform general tasks like viewing, developing, and deploying workflows.

However, only **Admins** will be able to manage workspace level settings, like inviting new members, changing member roles, renaming workspaces, etc.

#### Promoting a member to admin

To promote a member to an admin level account in your workspace, click the corresponding checkbox under their member entry.

#### Demoting an admin to a member

To demote an admin back to a member, uncheck the **Admin** checkbox in that members record in your workspace settings.

### Renaming a workspace

To rename a workspace, open your workspace settings and navigate to the **Account Settings** area.

Click the green check icon on the far right of the input to save the changes.

::: tip

  This action is only available to workspace **admins**.

### Deleting a workspace

To delete a workspace, open your workspace settings and navigate to the **Danger Zone**.

Click the **Delete workspace** button and confirm the action by entering in your workspace name and `delete my workspace` into the text prompt.

::: danger

Please be careful. This action will delete all **sources**, **workflows**, and **unpublished actions** corresponding with this workspace.

This deleting a workspace is **irreversible** and permanent.
